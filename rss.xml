It’s all of us who “okay, fuck it, keep doing it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life can be very difficult, very sad, very upsetting. But you don’t have to do it. You really don’t have to do it. You don’t have to do anything. You never have to do anything because you can kill yourself. Your boss call you to fix a crash you can just “No, I won’t” because you can kill yourself. You can do that. You can do that once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting because even when life gets bad, people choose it over nothing. Even the worst versions of life, even a shitty, shitty life, is worth living apparently. Because folks are living the shit of of them. Have you ever seen somebody, you’re like, “He should kill himself. Why did he not..that dude…“?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the truth: running away will not solve your problems. But killing yourselve solves all your problems. It even solves world’s problems. For you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bắt đầu mới]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tôi sống lại]]></description><link>https://google.com/bắt-đầu-mới/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://google.com/bắt-đầu-mới/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 08:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tôi sống lại&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
